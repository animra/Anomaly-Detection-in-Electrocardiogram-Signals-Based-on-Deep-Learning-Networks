**Anomaly Detection in Electrocardiogram Signals Based on Deep Learning Network**
The method of gathering the electric signals from a cardiac muscle throughout each cardiac cycle is called Electrocardiography (ECG). The health of the human heart is commonly measured using ECG signals. The anomaly detection in ECG signals is important to detect irregular cardiac beats, which classifies anomalous ECG signals earlier than the manual diagnosis progression by cardiologists or cardiac electrophysiologists. Especially, in terms of frequency or rhythms, the ECG artifacts which are quite similar to normal ECG signals are indistinguishable from previous research. Moreover, the false-positive (FP) rate of detection leans towards rising significantly even in influential deep learning networks. In this research, we propose an anomaly detection model based on deep Bi-directional long short-term memory units (BiLSTM), which can memorize the sequence of normal ECG signals. Our proposed model can detect anomalies efficiently from various test datasets with a very low false-positive rate.
